Use this extension to add one more more instances of [GridCMS](https://cms.grid.ws).

[GridCMS](https://cms.grid.ws) is a simple headless CMS based on Firestore, which allows you to define data types that can easily be managed directly in the system.

The schema is stored in Firestore (`_CMS_/schema` as default) and can be modified either by code or directly in the interface.
